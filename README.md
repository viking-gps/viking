## Contributing

First, read [hacking notes](HACKING).

In order to ease the creation of a development environment, there is a [development container]() description in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
This file can be used in different tools, like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) or to create online environments [Github Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers).
